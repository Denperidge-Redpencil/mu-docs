## Usage
Simply set the environment variables (through a .env file in this folder, or using your shell) and run `./run.sh`! It can be automated using GH Actions or crontab.
If you want to put the docs in this folder, make sure to set `DOCS=../`. Alternatively, you can use `DOCS=../docs/` to output in a subdirectory.
